# Clocksy. Powered by You.

This project is an ongoing venture of Iron Yard Houston Graduate J.T. Long, and has been made with love using VS Code, C#/.Net Core, and ReactJS. 

Database handling is in development to create user logins and upload saved projects and sessions.

Clocksy has the potential to enhance your productivity, or simply keep track of your screen time spent.
Its lightweight design is perfect for typists, freelance writers and developers, data analysts, number crunchers, teachers, bloggers - you name it!

Wherever you go, whatever you do with your machine, Clocksy can go the distance with you.

When fully complete, Clocksy will two modes of time-tracking: Standard and Pomodoro.

The Pomodoro Timer is in Development, but Standard Mode is Go.

- The Standard Tasktimer simply counts your minutes as long as you want it to, and you can take breaks as you go.

Standard Mode allows you to track billable and non-billable hours at the flip of a switch.
The built-in Break Timer runs parallel to the main timer and subtracts from the total session time.
Non-break time can be logged as billable time to submit for payment.

- For short bursts or time-sensitive duties, the Pomodoro Timer will allow you to dictate your workflow. It will feature billable inputs as well.

What's next? 

-Analytics and Workflow tracking.
The app will learn your most productive times throughout the day and suggest a schedule for you.

-Conquer your Wanderlust.
If you work abroad, Clocksy will adjust for time-zones. It will also suggest events and social functions wherever you are so you can unwind between sprints. Work hard, Play hard!
