The more you desperately want to be like someone else, the more unworthy you feel. 
The more you desperately want to be happier, the lonelier you become, despite the 
awesome people surrounding you.Mental toughness, happiness and living life to the
fullest come from knowing what to care aboutâ€“and most importantly, what not to care about.
