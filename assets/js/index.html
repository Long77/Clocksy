<!--The more you desperately want to be like someone else, the more unworthy you feel.
The more you desperately want to be happier, the lonelier you become, despite the awesome
people surrounding you. Mental toughness, happiness and living life to the fullest
come from knowing what to care aboutâ€“and most importantly, what not to care about.-->
